**Note:** Currenty, this app is in its super-early development state, so expect many bugs and a wierd experience using this (meantime i apologize for every inconvenient).

**PS:** Currently only supports the `realsr-animevideov3` model from Real-ESRGAN.

**PS 2:** The "Video" tab is still in development, but i plan adding the option to upscale entire videos in the future, just wait me some time 😴.
