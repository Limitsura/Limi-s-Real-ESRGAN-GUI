**Note:** Currenty, this app is in its super-early development state, so expect many bugs and a wierd experience using this (meantime i apologize for every inconvenient).

**PS: Currently only supports the `realsr-animevideov3` model from Real-ESRGAN.**

**PS 2: The "Video" tab is still in development, but i plan adding the option to upscale entire video's in the future, just wait me some time ðŸ˜´.**

## Still here? So get started! ðŸ‘€
